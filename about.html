                <h3 class="my-3 text-title">First Tech Challenge</h3>
                <p class="text-paragraph">We participate in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), which is one of the
                    competitions in the FIRST organization. We encourage you to go to the FIRST website
                    (www.firstinspires.org) to get a better understanding of the program. In short, the teams will be
                    working
                    together to build a small robot that is capable of performing a series of tasks, both in autonomous
                    and teleoperated modes, to compete in a “challenge” or game, which changes every year (i.e., you
                    would not be able to compete successfully using the robot you built the year before!). Every year a
                    challenge will be announced worldwide in September. The game is announced (with video presentation
                    and detailed game rules) on the FIRST web site.
                </p>
                <p class="text-paragraph">Once this year’s challenge is announced, the team will have approximately 7
                    months to completely build, program, and test a competition robot over the course of the season At a
                    minimum, we will participate
                    in the Austin Metro League meets and the Austin Metro League Champtionship. If we do well enough,
                    then we will advance to the Central Texas Regionals and then Worlds. We also participate in the
                    TAPPS State robotics competition.
                </p>
                <p class="text-paragraph">It should be emphasized that, while the ultimate goal is certainly to build a
                    robot capable of competing in the challenge, the broader goals of the FIRST organization are to
                    promote the full engineering process – design, modeling, building, programming, community service,
                    documentation, presentation, cooperation, team spirit, and troubleshooting. In fact, the top prize
                    at all FIRST competitions (the Inspire Award) is NOT necessarily given to the team who “wins” the
                    competition – it is given to the team which best combines all the attributes listed above.

                <p class="text-paragraph">The Iron Eagles Robotics team was founded in 2009 (the first year of operation
                    for
                    Savio). Our founder and director is a mechanical engineer at National Instruments (who is a major
                    supporter of the FIRST program). Our meeting times are set for Monday thru Thursday, 4:30 – 6:30
                    with occasional Saturday build days from 9:00 - 5:00.
                </p>
                <h3 class="my-3 text-title">Mentors</h3>
                <p class="text-paragraph">To teach us everything we would ever want to know about robots we have 4
                    amazing mentors: Michael Butler, Mike Gregorio, Scott Barnes, and Alex Thurlow.
                </p>
                <p class="text-paragraph">Additionally to oversee us and guide us in the
                    engineering design process we have 2 awesome faculty sponsors: Sylvia Wood and Ann Marie Girardot.

                <p class="text-paragraph">St. Dominic Savio Catholic High School is a co-educational college preparatory
                    school founded by the Diocese of Austin to prepare young men and women to become faith-filled,
                    visionary and inspirational leaders in service to the Church and the world.
